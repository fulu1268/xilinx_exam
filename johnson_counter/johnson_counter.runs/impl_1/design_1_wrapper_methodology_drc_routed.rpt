2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.222 ns between design_1_i/arithmetic_operations_0/U0/arithmetic_operations_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg2_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/arithmetic_operations_0/U0/arithmetic_operations_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/ALU_0/ALU_Result_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.005 ns between design_1_i/arithmetic_operations_0/U0/arithmetic_operations_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg2_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/arithmetic_operations_0/U0/arithmetic_operations_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/ALU_0/ALU_Result_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.816 ns between design_1_i/arithmetic_operations_0/U0/arithmetic_operations_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg2_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/arithmetic_operations_0/U0/arithmetic_operations_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/ALU_0/ALU_Result_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/jc2_0/U0/dir_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/jc2_0/U0/q_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/jc2_0/U0/q_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/jc2_0/U0/q_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/jc2_0/U0/q_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/jc2_0/U0/run_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
